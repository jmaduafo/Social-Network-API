# Social-Network-API

## Description
            
The motive of the assignment was to create a backend API for a social network using MongoDB and mongoose. The assignment helped me to better understand the process of setting up my own database for future full stack projects that I'll develop.

```
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

```

## Installation

In order to install the project, run "npm init" to create a package.json and then "npm i express mongoose" to install both express and mongoose. Express is used to create the routes for getting, post, putting, and deleting while mongoose is needed for the mongoDB schema and to connect the models to the MongoDB database. After installing the two packages, you can then run "node server" to run the server.js file which in turn runs localhost.

## Usage

The application should be used as an API where a user can fetch, post, update, and delete user info as well as thoughts and reactions.
